Sequence Search Tool allow searching protein sequences for motifs, sets of amino acids, regex expressions, or any other text. The tool generates a figure highlighting the location of the results. The tool can automatically fetch protein sequence from [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) based on their unique IDs. 

A live demo of the tool is available [here](http://bit.ly/sequencesearchtool). (Follow the directions on the page to login.)
